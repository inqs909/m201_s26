        "# Notebook 3: Are GPT Detectors biased against non-native English Speakers?\n",
        "\n",
        "In 2022, OpenAI released a large language model called ChatGPT, which was able to mimic human writing to a high level of degree. With this new tool available, fear from educators, and other stakeholders, about AI-generated content lead to the rise of known GPT detectors to determine if texts were human or AI written. A study published in the journal of *Patterns* highlights a potential concern: [Are GPT detectors biased against non-native English speakers?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389923001307) In this notebook, we will look into the data to determine if there is a biased component in GPT detectors. More information on the data set can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-07-18/readme.md)."
