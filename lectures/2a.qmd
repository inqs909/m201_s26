# Research Questions

## When are Research Questions Used?


## Why Research Questions Matter


- Research questions guide **what data you collect**
- They determine **which statistical methods** you can use
- Good questions lead to **clear, interpretable results**
- Weak questions lead to confusion, bias, or unusable data


## What Is a Research Question?

A research question is a **clear, focused, and answerable question** about a population or process that can be addressed using data.

::: fragment

In statistics, research questions usually involve:

- Variables
- Populations or samples
- Comparisons, relationships, or patterns

:::


## Research Questions vs. Topics


**Topic:**

- Social media use


**Research Question:**

- Is there a relationship between daily social media use (hours) and GPA among college students?



## Key Components


A strong research question clearly specifies:


1. **Population** (Who or what?)
2. **Variables** (What is measured?)
3. **Type of relationship** (Comparison, association, trend)
4. **Context** (Where, when, under what conditions?)

## Identifying the Population


Ask:

- Who am I studying?
- Is this a group I can realistically collect data from?



::: fragment
Examples:

- College students at a university
- Registered voters in a county
- Products manufactured on a given day
:::

## Identifying Variables


Variables must be:

- **Observable**
- **Measurable**


Common types:

- Quantitative (height, income, test scores)
- Categorical (gender, major, treatment group)

::: fragment
Example:

- Sleep duration (hours)
- Exam score (percentage)
:::


## Statistical Research Questions


Most intro statistics questions fall into one of these categories:


- Descriptive
- Comparative
- Relational (associational)

# Building Research Questions

## Identify Topics

First identify topics you are interested in learning more about.

## Construct Research Questions

Based on your topic, construct 2-3 research questions related to your topic.

## Key Components

Does your research question meet these components:

1. **Population** (Who or what?)
2. **Variables** (What is measured?)
3. **Type of relationship** (Comparison, association, trend)
4. **Context** (Where, when, under what conditions?)
