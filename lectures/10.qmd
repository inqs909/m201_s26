# Statistical Inference

## What is Statistical Inference?

-   Drawing conclusions about a **population** based on a **sample**
-   Population = entire group
-   Sample = subset

::: notes
Introduce the big idea: We want to make st
:::

## Two Main Types of Inference

1.  Estimation\
2.  Hypothesis Testing

::: notes
We'll be focusing on two fundamental techniques in inference. First, estimating population values (like the mean), and second, testing claims about the population.
:::

## Estimation

- **Point Estimate**: Single best guess (e.g., $\hat \beta_1$)
- **Interval Estimate**: Range likely to contain the true value

::: notes
Point estimates are easy but not very informative. Intervals give us a sense of uncertainty, which is critical in inference.
:::

## Hypothesis Testing

- $H_0$: No effect or difference\
- $H_1$: Some effect or difference\
- We use sample data to support or reject $H_0$

::: notes
Mention that $H_0$ is the default assumption. We only reject it if the data give us strong enough evidence.
:::

## Key Concepts and Tools

- Sampling Distribution
- Central Limit Theorem
- Standard Error

::: notes
These three concepts are foundational. Understanding them helps us assess how reliable our estimates are.
:::

## p-values

-   Probability of observing data as extreme as this if $H_0$ is true

Misinterpretation of p-values is common. Emphasize: low p-value means data is unusual under $H_0$.

## Confidence Intervals

-   A range where we expect the true value to fall

::: notes
Clarify interpretation: it's not about the probability the parameter is inside the interval, but about the method producing accurate intervals in the long run.
:::

# Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Tests

Hypothesis tests are used to test whether claims are valid or not. This is conducted by collecting data, setting the **Null** and **Alternative** Hypothesis.

## Null Hypothesis $H_0$

The null hypothesis is the claim that is initially believed to be true. For the most part, it is always equal to the hypothesized value.

## Alternative Hypothesis $H_a$

The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis.

## Example of Null and Alternative Hypothesis

We want to see if $\beta$ is different from $\beta^*$

| Null Hypothesis        | Alternative Hypothesis |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| $H_0: \beta=\beta^*$   | $H_a: \beta\ne\beta^*$ |
| $H_0: \beta\le\beta^*$ | $H_a: \beta>\beta^*$   |
| $H_0: \beta\ge\beta^*$ | $H_0: \beta<\beta^*$   |

## One-Side vs Two-Side Hypothesis Tests

Notice how there are 3 types of null and alternative hypothesis, The first type of hypothesis ($H_a:\beta\ne\beta^*$) is considered a 2-sided hypothesis because the rejection region is located in 2 regions. The remaining two hypotheses are considered 1-sided because the rejection region is located on one side of the distribution.

| Null Hypothesis        | Alternative Hypothesis | Side    |
|------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| $H_0: \beta=\beta^*$   | $H_a: \beta\ne\beta^*$ | 2-Sided |
| $H_0: \beta\le\beta^*$ | $H_a: \beta>\beta^*$   | 1-Sided |
| $H_0: \beta\ge\beta^*$ | $H_0: \beta<\beta^*$   | 1-Sided |

## Hypothesis Testing Steps

1.  State $H_0$ and $H_1$
2.  Choose $\alpha$
3.  Compute confidence interval/p-value
4.  Make a decision

::: notes
Walk through the steps slowly with an example in mind. Emphasize that $\alpha$ is a threshold, not the actual probability of error.
:::

## Rejection Region



## Rejection Region

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

alpha <- 0.05

# Critical values for two-tailed test
z_critical <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)

# Create data for the normal curve
x <- seq(-4, 4, length = 1000)
y <- dnorm(x)

df <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "deepskyblue", size = 1) +
  geom_area(data = subset(df, x <= -z_critical), aes(y = y), fill = "firebrick", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_area(data = subset(df, x >= z_critical), aes(y = y), fill = "firebrick", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-z_critical, z_critical), linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  theme_bw()
```


# Decision Making

## Decision Making

Hypothesis Testing will force you to make a decision: Reject $H_0$ **OR** Fail to Reject $H_0$

::: fragment
Reject $H_0$: The effect seen is not due to random chance, there is a process making contributing to the effect.
:::

::: fragment
Fail to Reject $H_0$: The effect seen is due to random chance. Random sampling is the reason why an effect is displayed, not an underlying process.
:::

## Decision Making: P-Value

The p-value approach is one of the most common methods to report significant results. It is easier to interpret the p-value because it provides the probability of observing our test statistics, or something more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.

::: fragment
**If** $p < \alpha$, then you reject $H_0$; otherwise, you will fail to reject $H_0$.
:::


## Decision Making: Confidence Interval Approach

The confidence interval approach can evaluate a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is $\beta\ne\beta^*$. The bootstrapping approach will result in a lower and upper bound denoted as: $(LB, UB)$.

::: fragment
**If $\beta^*$ is in $(LB, UB)$, then you fail to reject $H_0$. If $\beta^*$ is not in $(LB,UB)$, then you reject $H_0$.**
:::

## Significance Level $\alpha$

The significance level $\alpha$ is the probability you will reject the null hypothesis given that it was true.

::: fragment
In other words, $\alpha$ is the error rate that a research controls.
:::

::: fragment
Typically, we want this error rate to be small ($\alpha = 0.05$).
:::

# Power Analysis

## What is Statistical Power

- **Statistical Power** is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
- In other words, it's the chance of **detecting a real effect** when it exists.

## Why Power Matters

- Low power → high risk of **Type II Error** (false negatives)
- High power → better chance of finding true effects
- Common threshold: **80% power**

## Errors in Inference

|         |                               |                         |
|:--------|:------------------------------|:------------------------|
| Type I  | Reject $H_0$ when true        | False positive          |
| Type II | Don't reject $H_0$ when false | False negative          |
| Power   | $1 - P(\text{Type II})$       | Detecting a true effect |

::: notes
Power is often overlooked. It's about how sensitive the test is to real effects. Larger samples increase power.
:::

## Type I Error (False Positive)

-   **Rejecting** $H_0$ when it is actually true
-   Probability = $\alpha$ (significance level)

::: notes
Type I errors happen when we detect an effect that doesn't really exist. This is controlled by our chosen alpha level.
:::

## Type II Error (False Negative)

-   **Failing to reject** $H_0$ when it is actually false
-   Probability = $\beta$
-   Power = $1 - \beta$

::: notes
Type II errors are often due to small sample sizes or high variability. Power analysis helps us plan to avoid these.
:::

## Balancing Errors

-   Lowering $\alpha$ reduces Type I errors, but **increases** risk of Type II errors.
-   To reduce both:
    -   Increase sample size
    -   Use more appropriate statistical tests

::: notes
There's a trade-off between these errors. We can't eliminate both, but we can **manage** the risk based on the consequences of each type.
:::

## What Affects Power?

1. **Effect Size**  
   - Bigger effects are easier to detect

2. **Sample Size ($n$)**  
   - Larger samples reduce standard error

3. **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**  
   - Higher $\alpha$ increases power (but riskier!)

4. **Variability**  
   - Less noise in data = better power

## Boosting Power

- Power = Probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it's false
- Helps avoid **Type II Errors**
- Driven by:
  - Sample size
  - Effect size
  - $\alpha$
  - Variability
- Aim for **80% or higher**

# Confidence Intervals

## Confidence Intervals

- A confidence interval gives a **range of plausible values** for a population parameter.
- It reflects **uncertainty** in point estimates from sample data.

::: notes
Introduce confidence intervals as the natural next step after understanding sampling variability and standard error. Emphasize that point estimates are useful, but intervals give a more complete picture.
:::

## Interpretation

> "We are 95% confident that the true mean lies between A and B."

- This does **not** mean there's a 95% chance the mean is in that interval.
- It means: if we repeated the sampling process many times, **95% of the intervals would contain the true value**.

::: notes
This is one of the most common misconceptions. Clarify that the confidence is in the *method*, not any one interval.
:::

## Factors Affecting CI Width

-   Sample size ($n$): larger $n$ → narrower CI\
-   Standard deviation ($s$ or $\sigma$): more variability → wider CI\
-   Confidence level: higher confidence → wider CI

::: notes
Use this to summarize what controls how “precise” our confidence interval is. Give examples of each.
