# Probability Theory

## What is Probability?

**Probability** is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It ranges from 0 to 1:

- $P(A) = 0$: The event $A$ will definitely not happen.
- $P(A) = 1$: The event $A$ will definitely happen.
- Values between 0 and 1 represent varying degrees of likelihood.

## Everyday Examples
- What's the probability it will rain tomorrow?
- What are the chances of rolling a 6 on a standard die?
- How likely is it that a randomly chosen student has a GPA above 3.0?


## Key Terms and Definitions

::: panel-tabset

### **Experiment**
An action or process that generates outcomes.  
- Example: Rolling a die.

### **Sample Space**
The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.  
- Example: For rolling a die, $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

### **Event**
A subset of the sample space, representing outcomes of interest.  

- Example: Rolling an even number ($A = \{2, 4, 6\}$).

### **Prob. of an Event**
The proportion of times an event is expected to occur if the experiment is repeated many times.

:::

## The Probability Formula

The probability of an event $A$ is defined as:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$

## Example

If we roll a die, what is the probability of rolling a 4?

- **Favorable outcomes**: 1 (rolling a 4).
- **Total outcomes**: 6 (since $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$).

$$
P(\text{rolling a 4}) = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.167
$$


## Rules of Probability

::: panel-tabset

### Rule 1

**Probability of the Sample Space**

The probability of the sample space is always 1:
$$
P(S) = 1
$$

### Rule 2 

**Probability of Impossible Events**

The probability of an event that cannot happen is 0:

$$
P(\emptyset) = 0
$$

### Rule 3

**Complement Rule**

The probability of the complement of an event $A$ (not $A$) is:

$$
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
$$

- Example: If $P(\text{rain}) = 0.3$, then $P(\text{no rain}) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$.

## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### Drawing a Card
If you draw a card from a standard deck of 52 cards, what is the probability of drawing:

1. A heart?  
  $$
   P(\text{heart}) = \frac{13}{52} = 0.25
  $$

2. A red card (heart or diamond)?  
  $$
   P(\text{red card}) = \frac{26}{52} = 0.5
  $$

### Tossing a Coin Twice
What is the probability of getting:

1. Exactly one head?  
   Sample space: $S = \{\text{HH, HT, TH, TT}\}$.  
   Event: $A = \{\text{HT, TH}\}$.  
   $$
   P(A) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
   $$

2. At least one head?  
   Event: $B = \{\text{HH, HT, TH}\}$.  
   $$
   P(B) = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75
   $$

### Traffic Lights
A commuter encounters three traffic lights, each with a 70% chance of being green. Assuming independence, what is the probability that all three lights are green?

$$
P(\text{all green}) = 0.7 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.7 = 0.343
$$

# Joint Probability

## Joint Probability

*   Often, we're interested in the probabilities of multiple events occurring.
*   This presentation focuses on calculating probabilities involving two events.
*   We'll explore key concepts like:
    *   Joint Probability
    *   Union of Events
    *   Conditional Probability
    *   Independence


## Joint Probability

*   The probability of *both* events A and B occurring.
*   Denoted as $P(A\ \mathrm{and}\ B)$ or $P(A \cap B)$.
*   Examples:
    *   Drawing a King *and* a Heart from a deck of cards.
    *   Flipping two coins and getting heads on both.

## Union of Events

*   The probability of *either* event A *or* event B (or both) occurring.
*   Denoted as $P(A\ \mathrm{or}\ B)$ or $P(A \cup B)$.
*   Examples:
    *   Rolling a 3 or a 5 on a die.
    *   Drawing a red card or a face card.


## Calculating Union Probability

*   **General Case:** $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$  (Inclusion-Exclusion Principle)
*   **Mutually Exclusive Events:** If A and B are mutually exclusive (cannot both occur), then $P(A \cap B) = 0$, and $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$


## Example: Union Probability

*   What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 or an even number on a six-sided die?

    *   Event A: Rolling a number greater than 4 (5 or 6).
    *   Event B: Rolling an even number (2, 4, or 6).

::: fragment

*   $P(A) = 2/6$
*   $P(B) = 3/6$
*   $P(A \cap B) = 1/6$ (rolling a 6)
*   $P(A \cup B) = (2/6) + (3/6) - (1/6) = 4/6 = 2/3$
:::


## Conditional Probability

*   The conditional probability of event A occurring *given* that event B has occurred:  $P(A|B)$ (read as "the probability of A given B").

*   Formula:  $P(A|B) =\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

    *   $P(A|B)$: Conditional probability of A given B.
    *   $P(A \cap B)$: Probability of both A and B occurring.
    *   $P(B)$: Probability of B occurring.


## Independence

*   Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
*   If A and B are independent:
    *   $P(A|B) = P(A)$
    *   $P(B|A) = P(B)$
    *   $P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)$

## Bayes' Theorem

*   Reverses the conditioning:  Relates P(A|B) to P(B|A).
*   $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}$
*   Useful when we know P(B|A) but want P(A|B).


# Distribution Functions

## Random Variable

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. It's a way to map the outcomes of a probabilistic event to numbers. This allows us to analyze these outcomes mathematically.

## RV: Key Concepts

* **Random Phenomenon:** This is any process or experiment whose outcome is uncertain. 

* **Outcomes:** The possible results of a random phenomenon are called outcomes. 

* **Numerical Value:** A random variable assigns a numerical value to each outcome. 

## Types of Random Variables

::: panel-tabset

### Discrete Random Variable 

A discrete random variable can only take on a finite number of values or a countably infinite number of values. The values are often integers. Examples:

- The number of heads in three coin flips (0, 1, 2, or 3).
- The number of defective light bulbs in a box of 100.
- The number of customers entering a store in an hour.

### Continuous Random Variable

 A continuous random variable can take on any value within a given range. Examples:

- The height of a person.
- The temperature of a room.
- The time it takes to complete a task.

:::


## Distribution Functions

A **distribution function** describes the probabilities of a random variable across its possible values. It answers questions like:

- How likely is a random variable to take on a specific value or fall within a range?
- What is the overall "shape" of the distribution of outcomes?

## Cumulative Distribution Function

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** describes the probability that a random variable $X$ is less than or equal to a certain value $x$:
$$
F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)
$$

## Properties of the CDF

1. **Range**: The CDF is always between 0 and 1:
   $$
   0 \leq F_X(x) \leq 1
   $$
2. **Non-Decreasing**: The CDF never decreases as $x$ increases.
3. **Limits**:
   - $\lim_{x \to -\infty} F_X(x) = 0$
   - $\lim_{x \to \infty} F_X(x) = 1$

## CDF Example

For a die roll (discrete case):

- $F_X(2) = P(X \leq 2) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{2}{6}$.

For a normal distribution (continuous case):

- Use the CDF to find probabilities, typically provided via tables or software.


## Probability Density Function (PDF)

The **Probability Density Function (PDF)** is used for **continuous random variables** and describes the likelihood of the variable falling within a small interval.

$$
P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x) \, dx
$$


::: fragment
::: callout-important
$$
P(X = a) = P(a \leq X \leq a) = \int_a^a f_X(x) \, dx = 0
$$

:::
:::


## Properties of the PDF:

1. **Non-Negative**:
   $$
   f_X(x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x
   $$

2. **Total Area Under Curve**:
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_X(x) \, dx = 1
   $$

## PDF Examples

The PDF of the normal distribution is:
$$
f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

Here, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.



## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

The **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** is used for **discrete random variables** and gives the probability of each possible value:
$$
P(X = x) = p_X(x)
$$

## Properties of the PMF
1. **Non-Negative**:
   $$
   p_X(x) \geq 0 \quad \forall x
   $$

2. **Sum of Probabilities**:
   $$
   \sum_x p_X(x) = 1
   $$

## PMF Example

For a fair die, the PMF is:
$$
p_X(x) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad x \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
$$

## Percentiles

A **percentile** is a measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations falls. It is used in statistics to provide information about the relative standing of a particular value within a dataset.

## Percentile Example

Suppose we have a random variable X representing the height of adults in a population. If the 90th percentile of X is 180 cm, it means that the probability of a randomly selected adult being 180 cm or shorter is 90%.

## Precentile

```{r}
data <- rnorm(500000, mean = 100, sd = 15) |> data.frame(x = _)  # Example: normally distributed data

# Calculate the 75th percentile
percentile_75 <- qnorm(0.75, 100, 15)

ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_density(fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5) +  # Density curve
  geom_vline(xintercept = percentile_75, color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot with 75th Percentile Highlighted", x = "Data Value", y = "Density") +
  theme_bw()

```


## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### PMF of a Coin Toss
For a fair coin tossed once:

- $X = 0$: Tails, $P(X = 0) = 0.5$
- $X = 1$: Heads, $P(X = 1) = 0.5$

The PMF is:
$$
p_X(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
0.5 & x = 0 \text{ or } x = 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$


### CDF of an Exp. Dist.
An exponential random variable with rate $\lambda > 0$ has a CDF:
$$
F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 - e^{-\lambda x}, & x \geq 0 \\
0, & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

This can be used to model waiting times between events.

# Normal Distribution

## Normal Distribution

The **Normal Distribution** is a probability distribution that is symmetric, with most of the data points clustering around the mean. 

- It's **bell-shaped** and is defined mathematically by two parameters:
  - **Mean ($\mu$)**: The center or peak of the distribution.
  - **Standard Deviation ($\sigma$)**: Controls the spread of the distribution.


::: fragment
::: callout-important
For any normally distributed data, the highest probability density is at the mean, and as you move away from the mean, the probability density gradually decreases.
:::
:::

## Properties


1. **Symmetry**: It is perfectly symmetric about the mean, meaning the left side is a mirror image of the right.
2. **Unimodal**: There is a single peak at the mean.
3. **Mean, Median, and Mode are Equal**: In a normal distribution, these three measures of central tendency are located at the same point.
4. **68-95-99.7 Rule** (Empirical Rule)

::: notes

This rule helps us understand how data is distributed in a normal curve and provides a quick way to estimate probabilities for normally distributed data.

## The Standard Normal Distribution

The **Standard Normal Distribution** is a special type of normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's often used as a reference to convert any normal distribution to a standard form.

## Z-Scores
A **Z-score** (or standard score) tells us how many standard deviations an individual data point is from the mean. It’s calculated as:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

- If $Z$ is positive, the data point is above the mean.
- If $Z$ is negative, the data point is below the mean.
- Using Z-scores, we can compare values across different normal distributions or find the probability associated with a particular score.


## Why the Normal Distribution is Important


1. **It Describes Many Natural Phenomena**: Heights, weights, test scores, measurement errors, and countless other variables follow a normal distribution, especially when influenced by many small, random factors.
2. **Predictive Power**: With normally distributed data, we can make predictions and infer probabilities, thanks to the 68-95-99.7 rule.
3. **Central Limit Theorem**: The normal distribution is foundational to the Central Limit Theorem, which tells us that, regardless of the original data distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as sample size increases.
4. **Ease of Use in Statistical Methods**: Many statistical tests and methods assume normality, allowing for simplified calculations and reliable inferences.


## Apps of the Normal Dist.

::: panel-tabset

### Standardized Testing
Scores on standardized tests, such as IQ tests or the SAT, are often designed to follow a normal distribution. By knowing a student’s score in terms of Z-scores, we can determine their percentile or how they compare to other test-takers.

### Finance
In finance, stock returns and other economic factors are often modeled with a normal distribution to estimate risk, forecast trends, and make informed investment decisions.

# Empirical Rule


## What is the Empirical Rule?

The **Empirical Rule** provides a way to understand the spread of data in a normal distribution by describing how data points cluster around the mean. According to this rule:

1. Approximately **68%** of data points fall within **one standard deviation** of the mean.
2. Approximately **95%** of data points fall within **two standard deviations** of the mean.
3. Approximately **99.7%** of data points fall within **three standard deviations** of the mean.

The empirical rule is very helpful because, with just the mean and standard deviation, we can quickly estimate how data is distributed within a normal curve.


## Empirical Rule to the Normal Dist.

Let's define the key terms and apply the empirical rule to the normal distribution.

- **Mean (μ)**: This is the central point of the normal distribution where the data clusters around.
- **Standard Deviation (σ)**: This is a measure of how spread out the data points are from the mean.

## Empirical Rule to the Normal Dist.

In a normal distribution:

- **68% of data** lies between $(\mu - \sigma)$ and $(\mu + \sigma)$.
- **95% of data** lies between $(\mu - 2\sigma)$ and $(\mu + 2\sigma)$.
- **99.7% of data** lies between $(\mu - 3\sigma)$ and $(\mu + 3\sigma)$.

These intervals allow us to estimate probabilities for data within each range without needing to calculate exact probabilities.


## Visualizing the Empirical Rule

To better understand the empirical rule, imagine a symmetric, bell-shaped normal curve. Here’s how it would look based on the empirical rule:

1. The **68% region** represents the middle of the curve, starting one standard deviation left of the mean and ending one standard deviation right.
2. The **95% region** stretches further out, covering almost the entire curve except for the outer tails.
3. The **99.7% region** includes nearly all data points, covering the entire curve except for a tiny fraction at each extreme.

This visualization shows how the data is most concentrated around the mean, with less data appearing as we move further away.


## Using the Empirical Rule for Probabilities

The empirical rule helps us answer questions like:

- **What percentage of data points fall within a certain range?**
- **How unusual is a data point located far from the mean?**

## Examples

- If we know that a data point lies more than two standard deviations away from the mean, we know it’s in the outer 5% of the distribution, making it relatively rare.
- Using the rule, we can estimate that around 95% of values should lie within two standard deviations of the mean. If we observe data points outside of this range, we might consider them outliers.


## More Examples

::: panel-tabset

### Exam Scores
Suppose exam scores are normally distributed with a mean of 70 and a standard deviation of 10.

- **68% of students** scored between **60 and 80** (70 ± 10).
- **95% of students** scored between **50 and 90** (70 ± 20).
- **99.7% of students** scored between **40 and 100** (70 ± 30).

### Heights of Adults
Assume that adult heights follow a normal distribution with a mean height of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 8 cm.

- **68% of adults** have heights between **162 cm and 178 cm** (170 ± 8).
- **95% of adults** have heights between **154 cm and 186 cm** (170 ± 16).
- **99.7% of adults** have heights between **146 cm and 194 cm** (170 ± 24).

# Binomial Distribution

## Binomial Distribution

The **Binomial Distribution** is a probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, where each trial has:

- **Two possible outcomes**: typically called "success" and "failure."
- A constant probability of success, $p$, on each trial.

## Real-World Examples:

- Tossing a coin $n$ times and counting how many heads you get.
- Rolling a die $n$ times and counting how many times you roll a 6.
- Administering a medical treatment to $n$ patients and recording how many recover.

::: fragment

The binomial distribution answers questions like:

- "What is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 5 coin tosses?"
- "What is the likelihood of at least 4 successes in 10 trials?"

:::

## Conditions for a Binomial Experiment


1. **Fixed Number of Trials** ($n$):
   - The experiment consists of a set number of trials.

2. **Two Possible Outcomes**:
   - Each trial results in either a success (e.g., heads) or a failure (e.g., tails).

3. **Constant Probability of Success** ($p$):
   - The probability of success remains the same for each trial.

4. **Independence**:
   - The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcomes of other trials.



## The Binomial Probability Formula

$$
P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

Where:

- $P(X = k)$: Probability of exactly $k$ successes.
- $n$: Number of trials.
- $k$: Number of successes.
- $p$: Probability of success on a single trial.
- $1-p$: Probability of failure.
- $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$: Represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials



## Example Calculation
Suppose you flip a fair coin 5 times ($n = 5, p = 0.5$) and want to know the probability of getting exactly 3 heads ($k = 3$).

::: fragment
$$
P(X = 3) = \binom{5}{3} (0.5)^3 (1-0.5)^{5-3}
$$

:::

## Properties of the Binomial Dist.

::: panel-tabset

### Mean and Variance
For a binomial random variable $X$:

- **Mean (Expected Value)**: $\mu = n \cdot p$
- **Variance**: $\sigma^2 = n \cdot p \cdot (1-p)$
- **Standard Deviation**: $\sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}$

### Shape of the Distribution

- If $p = 0.5$, the distribution is symmetric.
- If $p > 0.5$, the distribution is skewed left.
- If $p < 0.5$, the distribution is skewed right.

### Quality Control
A factory produces lightbulbs, and 95% of them meet quality standards. If you randomly test 10 bulbs, what is the probability that exactly 8 bulbs pass the test?

Here:

- $n = 10$, $p = 0.95$, $k = 8$.

P(X = 8) = \binom{10}{8} (0.95)^8 (0.05)^2
$$

Here:
- $n = 5$, $p = 0.6$.

$$ 
P(X \geq 3) = P(X = 3) + P(X = 4) + P(X = 5)

# Poisson Distribution


## Poisson Distribution

The **Poisson Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval. These events must happen independently and at a constant average rate. 

## Real-World Examples

- The number of emails you receive in an hour.
- The number of cars passing through a toll booth in 10 minutes.
- The number of defects in a square meter of fabric.

::: fragment

The Poisson distribution helps us answer questions like:

- "What is the probability of receiving 5 emails in the next hour?"
- "How likely is it to have 2 defects in a single square meter?"

:::

## Conditions for the Poisson Dist.

1. **Events Occur Randomly**:
   - The events are random and unpredictable.

2. **Independence**:
   - The occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of another event occurring.

3. **Constant Average Rate** ($\lambda$):
   - The average number of events ($\lambda$) over a fixed interval remains constant.

4. **Non-Overlapping Intervals**:
   - Events in one interval do not influence events in another.


## The Poisson Probability Formula

$$
P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

Where:

- $P(X = k)$: Probability of $k$ events occurring.
- $\lambda$: Average number of events in the interval.
- $e \approx 2.718$
- $k!$: Factorial of $k$, calculated as $k \times (k-1) \times \dots \times 1$.

## Example Calculation

Suppose a call center receives an average of 10 calls per hour ($\lambda = 10$). What is the probability of receiving exactly 7 calls in the next hour ($ k = 7 $)?


$$
P(X = 7) = \frac{10^7 e^{-10}}{7!}
$$

## Poisson Distribution Properties

- **Mean**: $\mu = \lambda$
- **Variance**: $\sigma^2 = \lambda$
- **Standard Deviation**: $\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}$



## Applications

::: panel-tabset

### Traffic Flow
A toll booth observes an average of 3 cars passing through every 5 minutes ($\lambda = 3$). What is the probability of seeing exactly 5 cars in the next 5 minutes?

Using the formula:
$$
P(X = 5) = \frac{3^5 e^{-3}}{5!} = \frac{243 \cdot 0.0498}{120} \approx 0.1008
$$


### Defective Products

A factory produces an average of 2 defective items per day ($\lambda = 2$). What is the probability of finding no defective items in a day ($k = 0$)?

$$
P(X = 0) = \frac{2^0 e^{-2}}{0!} = e^{-2} \approx 0.1353
$$

# Probability in R

## Distributions in R

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
?Distributions
```


## Function Structure

|Letter|Functionality|
|:-|:-|
|"d"|returns the height of the probability density function|
|"p"|returns the cummulative density function value|
|"q"|returns the inverse cummulative density function (percentiles) |
|"r"|returns a randomly generated number|


## Probabilities

R can compute the probabilities of a distribution given the correct parameters:

-  Cummulative probability: `p` is used in front of the distribution R function 
-  Probability for a discrete distribution: `d` is used in front of the distribution R function
      - Note: Continuous Distribution Functions will not yield a valid probability value.


## Examples

::: panel-tabset

### 1

Find $P(X \leq 5 )$ where $X \sim N(6,2)$. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
pnorm(5, mean = 6, sd = 2)
```

### 2

Find $P(X \geq 7 )$ where $X \sim N(6,2)$. 


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
1 - pnorm(7, mean = 6, sd = 2)
```


### 3

Find $P(X = 20 )$ where $X \sim Bin(30,0.8)$. 


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
dbinom(20, size = 30, prob = 0.8)
```


:::

## More Examples

::: panel-tabset

### 1

Find $P(2 \leq X \leq 5 )$ where $X \sim N(6,2)$. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
pnorm(5, 6, 2) - pnorm(2, 6, 2) 
```

### 2

Find $P(14 < X < 20)$ where $X \sim Pois(16)$. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false


ppois(19, lambda = 16) - ppois(14, lambda = 16)

## OR

dpois(15, 16) + dpois(16, 16) + dpois(17, 16) + dpois(18, 16) + dpois(19, 16)
```

### 3

Find $P(23 < X)$ where $X \sim Pois(12)$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

1 - ppois(23, 12)

```

:::

## Percentiles

Finding the values (percentiles) for any distributions can be found by using the q-based distribution R function such as `qnorm()`, `qpois()`, and `qbinom()` functions.


## Examples

::: panel-tabset

### 1

Finding the $95^{th}$ percentile from $N(0,1)$, we will use the `qnorm()`. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
qnorm(.95, 0, 1)
```

### 2

Finding the $95^{th}$ percentile from a Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 9.5$.


```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
qpois(.95, 9.5)
```

### 3

Finding the $75^{th}$ percentile for $Bin(45,.4)$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
qbinom(.75, 45, .4)
```

## Random Number Generator

R is capable of generating random numbers. For example if we want to generate a random sample of size fifty from a normal distribution with mean eight and variance three, we will use the `rnorm()`. If we want to generate a random sample from any distribution, use the distribution function with `r` in front of it. 

## Examples

::: panel-tabset

### 1

Let's first generate the random sample of fifty from $X \sim N(8,3)$. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
rnorm(50, 8, sqrt(3))
```

### 2

Generate a random sample of 100 form an $X \sim Gamma (2,3)$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
rgamma(100, 2,3)
```

### 3

Generate a random sample of 100 form an $X \sim Binom (25,.23)$.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
rbinom(n = 100, size  = 25, prob = 0.23)
```

### 4

Generate a random sample of 100 form an $X \sim Pois (34.4)$. 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
rpois(n = 100, lambda = 34.4)
```
