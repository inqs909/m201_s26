# Motivation

## Motivation

The `ncbirths` data set provides information on whether different predictors. The outcome of interest will be `premie` ("full term" or "premie"). 

## Motivation 1

Model the relationship between the outcome `premie` and `habit` ("smoker" and  "nonsmoker").


## Motivation 2

Model the relationship between the outcome `premie` and `visits` ("smoker" and  "nonsmoker").



## Logistic Model 1

Use a logistic regression to model the outcome `premie` and `habit`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial())

```

## Odds Ratio 1

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
b(glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1)
exp(b(glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1))
```

## Odds Ratio 1

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
b(glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1)
exp(b(glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1))
```
The odds of a mother who smokes having a premature infant is 0.98 times lower than the odds of a mother who does not smoke.


## Logistic Model 2

Use a logistic regression to model the outcome `premie` and `visits`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial())

```

## Odds Ratio 2

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false
b(glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1)
exp(b(glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1))
```

## Odds Ratio 2

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
b(glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1)
exp(b(glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1))
```

As the number of hospital visits increases by 1, the odds of having a premature infant decreases by a factor 0.89.

# Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Tests

Hypothesis tests are used to test whether claims are valid or not. This is conducted by collecting data, setting the **Null** and **Alternative** Hypothesis.

## Null Hypothesis $H_0$

The null hypothesis is the claim that is initially believed to be true. For the most part, it is always equal to the hypothesized value.

## Alternative Hypothesis $H_a$

The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis.

## Example of Null and Alternative Hypothesis

We want to see if $\beta$ is different from $\beta^*$

| Null Hypothesis    | Alternative Hypothesis |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| $H_0: \beta=\beta^*$   | $H_a: \beta\ne\beta^*$     |
| $H_0: \beta\le\beta^*$ | $H_a: \beta>\beta^*$       |
| $H_0: \beta\ge\beta^*$ | $H_0: \beta<\beta^*$       |

## One-Side vs Two-Side Hypothesis Tests

Notice how there are 3 types of null and alternative hypothesis, The first type of hypothesis ($H_a:\beta\ne\beta^*$) is considered a 2-sided hypothesis because the rejection region is located in 2 regions. The remaining two hypotheses are considered 1-sided because the rejection region is located on one side of the distribution.

| Null Hypothesis    | Alternative Hypothesis | Side |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| $H_0: \beta=\beta^*$   | $H_a: \beta\ne\beta^*$     | 2-Sided |
| $H_0: \beta\le\beta^*$ | $H_a: \beta>\beta^*$       | 1-Sided |
| $H_0: \beta\ge\beta^*$ | $H_0: \beta<\beta^*$       | 1-Sided |

## Decision Making

Hypothesis Testing will force you to make a decision: Reject $H_0$ **OR** Fail to Reject $H_0$

::: fragment
Reject $H_0$: The effect seen is not due to random chance, there is a process making contributing to the effect. 
:::

::: fragment
Fail to Reject $H_0$: The effect seen is due to random chance. Random sampling is the reason why an effect is displayed, not an underlying process.
:::



## Decision Making: P-Value

The p-value approach is one of the most common methods to report significant results. It is easier to interpret the p-value because it provides the probability of observing our test statistics, or something more extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true. 


::: fragment
**If $p < \alpha$, then you reject $H_0$; otherwise, you will fail to reject $H_0$.**
:::

## Decision Making: Confidence Interval Approach

The confidence interval approach can evaluate a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is $\beta\ne\beta^*$. The bootstrapping approach will result in a lower and upper bound denoted as: $(LB, UB)$. 


::: fragment
**If $\beta^*$ is in $(LB, UB)$, then you fail to reject $H_0$. If $\beta^*$ is not in $(LB,UB)$, then you reject $H_0$.**
:::

## Significance Level $\alpha$

The significance level $\alpha$ is the probability you will reject the null hypothesis given that it was true. 

::: fragment
In other words, $\alpha$ is the error rate that a research controls.
:::

::: fragment
Typically, we want this error rate to be small ($\alpha = 0.05$).
:::

## Hypothesis Test Process

::: incremental
1.  Set up the Null and Alternative Hypothesis.

    - $H_0: \beta = 0$ and $H_a: \beta \ne 0$

2.  Compute p-value or confidence interval

3.  Make a decision 

4.  Interpret the results

# Example 1

## Example

Use a logistic regression to model the outcome `premie` and `habit`.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| eval: false

glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial())
b(glm(premie ~ habit, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1)

## Example

## Logistic Model 2

```{r}

exp(b(glm(premie ~ visits, data = ncbirths, family = binomial()), 1))
