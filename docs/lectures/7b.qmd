# Modeling Outcomes

## Explaining Variation

::: fragment
This is the process where we try to reduce the variation with the use of other variables.
:::

::: fragment
Can be thought of as getting it less wrong when taking an educated guess.

## Taylor Swift's Songs Danceability

```{r}
ggplot(taylor_album_songs, aes(danceability)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Danceability by `mode_name`

```{r}
taylor_album_songs |> 
  drop_na(mode_name) |> 
  ggplot(aes(danceability)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~ mode_name)
```

## Danceability by Valence

```{r}
ggplot(taylor_album_songs, aes(valence, danceability)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Danceability by Energy

```{r}
ggplot(taylor_album_songs, aes(energy, danceability)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Modelling Danceability

How do we use all the variables to explain danceability?

# Multivariable Linear Regression

## MLR

Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR) is used to model an outcome variable ($Y$) by multiple predictor variables ($X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p$).


::: fragment
Using MLR, you propose that the ouctome variable was constructed from a set of predictors, with their corresponding regression coefficients ($\beta$), and a bit of error
:::


::: fragment
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p + \varepsilon
$$

$$
\varepsilon \sim DGP
$$
:::

## Model Data

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p + \varepsilon
$$

$$
\varepsilon \sim DGP
$$

::: fragment

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip} + \varepsilon_i
$$

$$
\varepsilon_i \sim DGP
$$

:::

## Unknown Parameters

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip} + \varepsilon_i
$$

::: fragment
$$
\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \ldots, \beta_p
$$
:::

## Estimated Model

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip} + \varepsilon_i
$$

$$
\hat Y_i = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 X_{i1} + \hat\beta_2 X_{i2} + \cdots + \hat\beta_p X_{ip} 
$$

## Estimating Prameters

$\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \ldots, \beta_p$ are estimated by minimizing the following function:


$$
\sum^n_{i=1} (Y_i-\hat Y_i)^2
$$


## Fitting a Model in R

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + Xp, data = DATA)
```


## Modelling Danceability

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
lm(danceability ~ mode_name + valence + energy, 
   data = taylor_album_songs)
```

## Estimated Model

$$
dance = 0.54 + 0.07\times Minor + 0.18 \times valence - 0.06 \times energy 
$$

## $\hat \beta_i$ Representation

Each regression coefficient $\beta_i$ represents how the predictor variable changes the outcome, as it increase by 1 unit.

::: fragment
For categorical dummy variables, the $\beta_i$ represents how the outcome will change when the data point belongs to that value.
:::


## $\hat \beta_i$ Interpretation

For $hat \beta_i$, which is the regression coefficient (slope) of $X_i$:

As $X_i$ increases by 1 unit, the outcome ($Y$) will increase/decrease by $\hat \beta_i$ units, adjusting for all other predictor variables.

::: fragment
For categorical dummy variables $X_i$:

The outcome $Y_i$ increases/decreases by $\beta_i$ units for category $X_i$ compared to the reference category, adjusting for all other predictor variables.

:::


## Intepreting Minor coefficient

$$
dance = 0.54 + 0.07 Minor + 0.18 valence - 0.06 energy 
$$
Minor song's average danceability score is 0.07 units higher compared to Major song's, adjusting for valence and energy.

## Intepreting valence coefficient

$$
dance = 0.54 + 0.07Minor + 0.18  valence - 0.06 energy 
$$

As valence increases by 1 unit, danceability increases by an average of 0.18 units, adjusting for energy and type of song.


## Intepreting energy coefficient

$$
dance = 0.54 + 0.07 Minor + 0.18 valence - 0.06 energy 
$$

As energy increases by 1 unit, danceability decreases by an average of 0.06 units, adjusting for valence and type of song.


# Adjusted $R^2$

## $R^2$

Computing $R^2$ is done by determining how much the variation in the outcome is explained by model and divided by the variation of the outcome.

$$
R^2 = \frac{\text{variation explained by model}}{\text{variation from outcome}} \\
= 1-\frac{\text{variation of residuals}}{\text{variation from outcome}}
$$

## $R^2$

Problems arise when multiple predictors are added to the model. As a new predictor is added to the model, new information is added to the model which will always reduce the variation in the residuals. Therefore, the $R^2$ will always increase.

## Problems with $R^2$ in MLR

When the number of variables increase, the regular $R²$ will be biased in its prediction capability when new data is obtained.

::: fragment
Therefore, statisticians uses the adjusted $R^2$, that penalizes the model when more variables are added. This ensures that a variable added will have a significant effect in predicting outcomes.
:::

## Adjusted $R^2$

$$
R_a^2 = 1-\frac{\text{variation of residuals}}{\text{variation from outcome}}\times \frac{n-1}{n-k-1}
$$

- $n$: Number of data points
- $k$: Number of predictor variables in the model

## Adjusted $R^2$ in R

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

xlm <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... + Xp, data = DATA)
ar2(xlm)
```


## Example

```{r}
xlm <- lm(danceability ~ mode_name + valence + energy, 
   data = taylor_album_songs)
ar2(xlm)
```

8.1% of the variation in danceability is explained by the model.

# Model Selection

## Model Selection

Model Selection is the process of obtaining a "final" model containing all the necessary predictors, and eliminating any that are not necessary.

## Forward Selection

Begin with the null model ($Y\sim 1$) and add variables until a final model is chosen.

## Backward Selection

Begin with the full model, and remove variable until the final model is chosen.

## Hybrid Selection

A hybrid approach between the forward and backward building approach.

## About Model Selection

Generally, it is not a good idea to conduct model selection. The predictor variables in your model should be guided by a literature review that illustrates important predictor variables in a model.
