# Data

## Observations

An observation is the unit which contains information to be obtained.

::: fragment
Also known as experimental unit.
:::

## Data

Data is information from a particular experimental unit. There can be more that one piece of information per experimental unit.

## Data Structure

The structure of the data can be represented in various forms:

-   A list of long numbers

-   Table

## Tabular Form

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
penguins |> 
  DT::datatable(options = list(dom = "t",
                pageLength = 4))

```

# Measurements

## Measurements

Measurements are the processes where we represent an attribute of an experimental unit as either a number or category.

## Quantitative Measurements

Quantitative measurements are data measurements that take a numeric form.

## Qualitative Measurements

Qualitative measurements are data measurements that take a certain category.

## Value

A value is a description (number or category) of a specific attribute of an experimental unit.

## Variable

A variable is the descriptive attribute that we want to obtain from an experimental unit. In terms of a data set, the variable contains all the values of specific attribute in a sample.


# Study Design

## Research Question

- A research question is designed to create new knowledge of certain phenomenons observed in the world.
- This is designed by conducting a research project that systematically answers the question.
- The study design is the procedure in which data is collected to answer the question, while reducing any potential bias while conducting the study.

## Study Design

- This is the procedure designed to answer a research question.

- Entails procedures to collect data that answers a research question.
- Dictates how the data will be analyzed.
- Determines how the data is quantified and what is the experimental unit.

# Sampling

## Sampling

The process of a selecting a small subset from a large population.

## Sampling

When Sampling you want to maintain these properties:

-   Representative sample

-   Large enough sample size

## Sampling Example

We want to answer the question, are people happy?


## Random Sampling

When sampling, we strive for random sampling

-   Each unit in the population of interest must have an equal probability of being selected for the study.

-   This ensures a representative population

## Independent Sampling

In addition to random sampling, we strive to make sure each unit is independent from each other.

-   The probability of UNIT A being sampled will not affect the probability of UNIT B to be sampled.

## Sampling Variation

-   Random samples may vary from the population of interest.

-   Due to randomness, samples many not look the same or biased.

-   However, this is to be expected as the sample will not be biased in one way or another.

-   Samples are then considered unbiased as long as experimental units were collected randomly.

# Data Generating Process

## Data

The measurement collected from an experimental unit.

## Data Distribution

When thinking about data, we know an attribute is allowed to vary. With this variation, some numbers are more likely to be observed than others.

## Sample

::: incremental
When inspecting data:

-   Do not focus on one individual data point.

-   See how data points is in relation to other data points.

-   See what is common

-   See what is rare
:::

## Data Generation Process (DGP)

The data generation process is understanding how variation from the population is transferred to the data collected.

::: fragment
A population has a mechanism to produce data, understanding this mechanism is essential understanding the data.
:::

## DGP

A populations DGP can be defined with the following characteristics:

-   The potential outcomes that can be observed when measuring

-   Each potential outcome will have a probability of being observed

    -   The probability must be between 0 and 1

-   Sum of all the probabilities of each outcome will add up to 1

## Flipping a Coin

- Flipping a coin results in either heads or tail. 

- The probability for heads is 50%

- The DGP of flipping a coin is the process of selecting an outcome, given the probability of both options are 50%.

## Inference

- How do we use DGP and sampling to understand the world?

- We can use a sample to understand the DGP.
- We can use the DGP to understand the sample.

## Visualizing a DGP

```{r}
#| echo: false

seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000) |> 
  dbeta(shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5) |> 
  tibble(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000), y = _) |>
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("DGP") + ylab("Density") 
```

## Visualizing DGP

```{r}
#| echo: false
rbinom(200000, size = 20, prob = 1/5) |> 
  tibble(y = _) |>
  ggplot(aes(y)) + geom_bar() + 
  ggtitle("DGP") + ylab("Frequency") 
```

## Example

```{r}
#| echo: false

g1 <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000) |> 
  dbeta(shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5) |> 
  tibble(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000), y = _) |>
  ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_line() + 
  ggtitle("DGP") + ylab("Density") 

g2 <- rbeta(100, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5) |> 
  tibble(y = _) |>
  ggplot(aes(y)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), col = "gray70", fill = "gray") +
    geom_density(col = "red", lwd = 1) +
    ggtitle("Sample") + ylab("Density") 


g1 + g2 
```

# Statistical Model

## Statistical Model

$$
Y \sim F(\theta)
$$

- $Y$: A data value generated for DGP
- $F$: A generic mathematical model that describes the DGP
- $\theta$: Parameter controlling the shape and form of the DGP

## Statistical Model

$$
Y = \beta + \varepsilon 
$$


- $\beta$: The average value we expect to see
- $\varepsilon \sim F(\cdot)$: Error Term

## Statistical Model
$$
Y = \beta + \varepsilon 
$$

::: columns

::: column
$\beta$: Explained Part

- This is what we expect to see if we took an educated guess
- The educated guess can incorporate information that is related to $Y$

:::
::: column
$\varepsilon$: Unexplained Part

- Incorporates several types of variation
  - Measurement Error
  - Biological Error
