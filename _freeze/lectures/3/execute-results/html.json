Each cell in the table represents the count or frequency of observations that fall into a particular combination of categories for the variables.\n\n## Key Features of Cross-Tabulations\n\n1. **Rows and Columns**: \n   - Rows represent the categories of one variable.\n   - Columns represent the categories of another variable.\n2. **Cells**:\n   - Each cell displays the frequency or count of data points that belong to the intersection of a row and column category.\n3. **Margins**:\n   - Row and column totals provide summaries for each variable.\n   - The grand total shows the overall sample size.\n\n\n## Types of Proportions in Cross-Tabulations\n\n1. **Row Proportions**: Show the percentage of each row total represented by a cell.\n2. **Column Proportions**: Show the percentage of each column total represented by a cell.\n3. **Table Proportions**: Show the percentage of the overall total represented by a cell.\n\n\n## Table Proportions\n\nTable proportions in cross-tabulations refer to the relative frequency or percentage of counts within the entire table, calculated by dividing each cell’s count by the total sum of all counts in the table. These proportions allow you to examine the contribution of each cell to the overall data set.\n\n## Table Proportions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat_stats(coffee$caffeine, coffee$taste, prop = \"table\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Row Proportions\n\nRow proportions refer to the relative frequency or percentage of counts within each row of a contingency table.

The size of each slice is proportional to the relative frequency or magnitude of the category it represents.\n\n## Pie Charts\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](3_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Key Features of Pie Charts\n1. **Circular Format**: \n   - The chart is shaped like a circle, symbolizing a whole (100% or 1).\n2. **Slices**:\n   - Each slice corresponds to a category and its size represents the contribution of that category to the total.\n3. **Labels**:\n   - Slices are often labeled with the category name and the percentage or value they represent.\n\n\n## Pie Chart in R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_pie <- cat_stats(coffee$caffeine, tbl_df = TRUE)$table\nggplot(df_pie, aes(cat = Category, val = n, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_pie()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Pie Chart in R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncoffee_pie <- cat_stats(coffee$caffeine, tbl_df = TRUE)$table\nggplot(coffee_pie, aes(cat = Category, val = n, fill = Category)) +\n  geom_pie()\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Mosaic Plots\n\nA **mosaic plot** is a graphical representation of two categorical variables. It uses rectangles to visualize the proportions of data categories while simultaneously showing the relationships between multiple variables. The size of each rectangle corresponds to the relative frequency or proportion of the data in a particular category combination.\n\n## Key Features of Mosaic Plots\n1. **Rectangular Tiles**:\n   - The plot is divided into rectangles, with each tile representing a unique combination of categories.\n2. **Proportional Areas**:\n   - The area of each rectangle is proportional to the frequency or proportion of the data it represents.\n3. **Hierarchical Arrangement**:\n   - Variables are arranged hierarchically along the axes, with the tiles subdivided to represent relationships between variables.\n4. **Color Coding (Optional)**:\n   - Different colors can be used to highlight specific patterns, emphasize groups, or indicate significance.\n\n\n# Theming\n\n## Themes\n\nThe R packages `ThemePark` and `ggthemes` allows you to change the overall look of a plot.\n\n::: fragment\nAll you need to do is add the theme to the plot.\n:::\n",
