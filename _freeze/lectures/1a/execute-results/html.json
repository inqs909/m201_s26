Don't give up when it gets hard and seek out help when needed.\n\n# Statistics Activity\n\n## When do you use statistics?\n\n## What is the difference between math and stats?\n\n\n# Use of Generative AI\n\n## Use of Generative AI\n\nThe use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) to complete any part or all of an assignment/exam is strictly prohibited in this class. This includes, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may use AI to enhance you understanding of the material.\n\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n\nYou may not upload any course material to any AI platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, and Google Gemini.  Exceptions are allowed for [DASS](https://www.csuci.edu/dass/)-approved services.\n\n\n:::\n\n## Use of AI\n\nThere are consequences when you use of AI:\n\n- Educational Mislearning\n- Trusting AI\n- Stolen Work\n- Privacy Concerns\n- Environmental Impacts\n- Working Exploitation\n\n\n\n## Educational Mislearning\n\nThe purpose of this class, and college, is for you to learn about critical thinking skills and perseverance. Using AI will only teach you how to get an answer, which may or may not be correct. \n\n::: fragment\nYou will not develop the skills needed to problem solve a challenge. Additionally, developing grit is essential to become successful in college and life. There is no easy way out and AI is an illusion to your success in life.\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\nTo learn something, it requires hours of work! If not years!\n:::\n\n## Trusting AI\n\nWhen using AI, you must acknowledge its limitations:\n\n::: incremental\n\n- Responses provided may be incorrect\n\n- Responses may not be fair\n\n- Companies may manipulate responses and/or terms of service for their benefit\n\n- Companies may not have your best interst in mind\n:::\n\n::: fragment\n\n**You should always proceed with caution utilizing these tools!**\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Stolen Work\n\n::: fragment\nAdditionally, all these individuals are not receiving any royalties for the work to be used in creating generative AI models.\n:::\n\n\n::: fragment\n[Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2024/07/29/taylor-francis-ai-deal-sets-worrying-precedent) and [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/is-ai-art-stealing-from-artists) highlight individual's concern of their work being used to train AI models.\n:::\n\n\n## Privacy Concerns\n\nThe use of generative AI raises concerns of what data is being harvested from us, possibly without informed consent. \n\n::: fragment\nWhen you used any large language models, you do not know what information is being harvested from you.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nDo you want to upload your thoughts and ideas to a company that can monetize, and possibly exploit.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nDoes your Professors consent with you uploading their assignments to large language models?\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nStanford provided a [report](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/privacy-ai-era-how-do-we-protect-our-personal-information) highlighting the risks of our personal data use in large language models.\n:::\n\n## Environmental Impact\n\nIn order to run these large language models, companies need to use a large amounts of energy. This is because large servers are needed to both train and execute a model. \n\n::: fragment\nThe [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-08-15/editorial-generative-ai-is-a-leading-contributor-to-our-energy-consumption-how-will-this-impact-our-climate) reports the potential impact that running AI models in California.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nAdditionally, [Time](https://time.com/6987773/ai-data-centers-energy-usage-climate-change/) reports that a ChatGPT query uses ten times more energy than a Google search query, and global AI demands can consume of 1 trillion gallons of water by 2027.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nThere are also environmental justice questions about where these data centers are constructed.\n:::\n\n## Worker Exploitation\n\nThe [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/08/28/scale-ai-remotasks-philippines-artificial-intelligence/) and Time ([Article 1](https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/) and [Article 2](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/)) reported that AI companies utilize \"digital sweatshops\" to classify data points for model training. \n\n::: fragment\nThere is a human cost from the Global South, both financially and mentally, to develop the AI models for users in the United States and Europe.\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nWe must be conscious consumers and demand more from these companies to provide safe working conditions and livable wages.\n:::\n\n\n## Is Using AI Bad?\n\n::: fragment\nYes/No/IDK\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nBut, we need to acknowledge the consequences of using AI!\n:::\n\n::: fragment\nAnd, we need to demand companies to create and implement AI in an ethical manner!\n:::\n\n# Surveys\n\n## Intro Form\n\n[Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCOoa1nw4mrFA9svC12LNDSh618MEijHFE8Rcop2Nb0BJgAQ/viewform?usp=publish-editor)\n\n![](img/qr-code.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## First Survey\n\n[Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYV9qxgaxv53MmQtxUtL26os_L7LsLaCgQKx8zyQ4vA13TaA/viewform?usp=publish-editor)\n\n![](img/qr-code-1.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n# Extra Credits\n\n\n## Extra Credit 1\n\n<p><iframe title=\"embedded content\" src=\"https://m201.inqs.info/ec/ec_1.html\" width=\"1100\" height=\"700\"></iframe></p>\n\n## Extra Credit 2\n\n<p><iframe title=\"embedded content\" src=\"https://m201.inqs.info/ec/ec_2.html\" width=\"1100\" height=\"700\"></iframe></p>\n\n## Extra Credit 3\n\n<p><iframe title=\"embedded content\" src=\"https://m201.inqs.info/ec/ec_3.html\" width=\"1100\" height=\"700\"></iframe></p>\n\n# Field Trip",
